<p>cheetah is the most fastest land animals on earth so it can run 200km/h so that mean it can run as fast it can </p>

<p>cheetah skin is very valuable since poarchus usualy search for such animals for there skins </p>

<p>I want to acknowledge that wildlife service such as Kenya Wildlife Service to take care for wild animals since they are very important to us</p>
